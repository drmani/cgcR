# cgcR

We are collecting R code and tutorial materials for the Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots here.  Feel free to contribute anything, including
issues.  Much of the tutorial material does not require R.  To view, navigate to the [vignettes](tree/master/vignettes) directory.

## Installing the R package

Very much a work in progress showing examples of using the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud pilots from R.

To install:

```{r}
devtools::install_github('teamcgc/cgcR',dependencies=TRUE)
```
