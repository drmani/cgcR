FireCloud, developed and maintained by the Broad Institute, is one of the three National Cancer Institute's Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots.  <https://software.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/>.  This documment provides step-by-step description of creating a project on the FireCloud and upload RNA-seq (BAM) data.  Before completing this tutorial, please set up an user account and a billing account with the instructions on the Firecloud's website.

This tutorial is written using the *Google Chrome as browser*.

1. Click "Sign In"
2. Sign in with your google credential

*Note*: If you have multiple google accounts, log in in an incognito window by clicking File -> New Incognito Window


#### TCGA access

After you log in, your profile is displayed.  
If you have an NIH account, link your NIH account.

1. Click "Log-In to NIH to re-link your account"
2. Log in with your NIH credential

*Note*: You will need to renew/re-link your account periodically


#### Create and Share New Workspace
<https://software.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/guide/topic?name=firecloud-basics>
The FireCloud world is organized into workspaces.  

A workspace is a computational sandbox where you can organize genomic data and tools, and run analyses. Users can create, share, and clone workspaces. Workspaces hold:  

- Data: pre-loaded or user-uploaded, open access or controlled access  
- Workflows: pre-loaded or user-created  
- Tools: pre-loaded or user-created  
- Results: from all runs, captured with provenance  

After you log in, your workspaces will be displayed.  Workspaces that are TCGA access-controlled are labeled "Restricted."

To create a new workspace

1. Click on the blue botton on the upper-right-hand-corner "Create New Workspace... +"
2. Make sure it is in the correct Google Project linked to the billing account (Refer to the Billing section above)
3. Enter workspace name "IRPworkshop"
4. Enter workspace description, if any.
5. If this project will contain TCGA control data, check the box "Workspace intended to contain NIH protected data." If not, leave it unchecked.
6. Click "Create Workspace"

Once a workspace is created, you can share with other users.
Under "Summary" tab, under "Workspace Owner", you should see your gmail account listed.
To share this workspace

1. Click "(Sharing...)" next to the gmail account
2. A pop-up window will appear
3. Click "Add new +"
4. Enter user gmail address
5. Set access level for the user (OWNER, WRITER, READER, NO ACCESS)
6. Click "Save"

#### Upload my data to the FireCloud

To upload file,

1. Click on the line under "Google Bucket" which opens the Google Cloud Storage browser for this workspace
2. You will be taken to the Google Cloud Platform
3. Click "Upload Files"
4. Select all the .bam and .bai files
5. Click "Open"
6. Multiple file tends to only upload 3 files simultaneously, repeat this process as necessary until all bam/bai files are uploaded and can be seen in the Google Console

Once the files are uploaded to the Google console, you need to add them to the workspace.  
To do this, you need two TSV files that describes the bam/bai files.  
The first one, called "participants.tsv" has information about the participants and disease type.  
 
  
participant_id/sample_id fields are set arbitrarily and should be unique.  
<br>
participant.tsv
```{}
entity:participant_id	disease
G28029	                BRCA
G41676	                BRCA
G41659	                LCLL
G41707	                LCLL
```

The second one, called "sample.tsv" has information about the bam/bai files. sample.tsv has four columns, "sample_id", "BAM_index", "participant_id", and "BAM."   
- "sample_id" is arbitrarily set and should be unique.  
- "pariticpant_id" should match the participant_id in "participant.tsv" 
- "BAM_index"/"BAM" are addresses where the bam/bai files are in the Google Cloud Storage.  

The address should have the format "gs://[Google_Bucket]/[file_name]"  
If your Google Bucket location is "fc-974b342c-b6f2-45e7-b901-xxxxxxxxxxxx" and file name is "NGS.bam", your address in that column should be "gs://c-974b342c-b6f2-45e7-b901-xxxxxxxxxxxx/NGS.bam"  For clarity, full file address is not listed below.

sample.tsv  
```{}
entity:sample_id  BAM_index   	participant_id	BAM
G28029_sample     bai_address1	G28029	        bam_address1  
G41676_sample     bai_address2	G41676          bam_address2  
G41659_sample     bai_address3	G41659	        bam_address3  
G41707_sample     bai_address4  G41707	        bam_address4  

```

Once your have the two TSV files created, go back to the workspace.

1. Click on "Data" tab
2. Click "Import Data..."
3. Click "Importa from file"
4. Click "Choose file..."
5. Select "participant.tsv" that you created above
6. Click "Open"
7. Click "Upload" and you should see a "Upload Successful" message

1. Click "Import Data..."
2. Click "Import from file"
3. Click "Choose file..."
4. Select "sample.tsv" that you created above
5. Click "Open"
6. Click "Upload" and you should see a "Upload Successful" message

That's it.  You have uploaded the files to the workspace.  

When you click on the address for the bam files, you will see 

```{}
Object: G28029_pe.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.sorted.bam
File size: 974.40 MBOpen (right-click to download)ÓÄèWarning: Downloading this file may incur a large data egress charge
```
Please note that uploading to the Firecloud is free, but you will be charged for downloading files.

More to come later on running analysis with those uploaded files.
